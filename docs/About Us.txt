What is Career Agent?

We have all been there; on the Job hunt, looking for work in an under-saturated job market. We look for the perfect position and despite the plethora of different openings, none seem to cater to our skills, or are simply unappealing to our lifestyles. 

The multitude of positions we have to go through to find a single opening that fits our needs can be daunting enough. Once we find that position, how many people must we compete with? Have we tailored our resumes? Have we become adequately prepared for the interview process? How can we gain a leg-up on the competition? 

The fact is that the job hunt is a lot of work, made exponentially worse by the fact that we are generally alone in the pursuit. That is where Career Agent comes into play; we will be your partner in finding the right position, throughout the process. We take the burden off your shoulders, using our proven process to secure the position you need.

Career Agent has successfully coached clients – throughout the US and in numerous industries — through job search campaigns. We use our full understanding of you, the client to develop a profile for the right positions, in the right industry. Our professionals will do all the leg work. Each professional Career Agent customizes a client’s job search campaign to meet their needs, and most importantly…to get the job done. 
 They will then fully prepare you for the hiring process, providing literature on everything you need to know to compete. All you have to do is sit back, and wait for the opportunities to pour in.
